# Background

CCSC is currently working as a sub-contractor to The Energy Coalition (TEC) to develop an "Advanced Energy Community" within the LA County unincorporated neighborhoods of Bassett and Avocado Heights (BAAEC). This project has a number of components including: the development of a local community solar generation facility whose output will support a Virtual Net Metering program, creation of a set of "Advanced Energy Homes" which will have a combination of distributed energy resources and electrified appliances, installation of publicly accessible EV charging infrastructure, air-quality monitoring, and more.

For more information about this ongoing work please visit the project's public website: [Bassett & Avocado Heights Advanced Energy Community Website](https://advancedenergycommunity.org)

# Methods

The map below depicts the geographic boundaries of the BAAEC project's area of interest/eligibility as well as several other relevant spatial attributes. Community members living within this area are eligible to participate either in the Community Solar or Advanced Energy Homes portions of the project - subject to other limitations and constraints.
