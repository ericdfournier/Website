				I'm glad you made it. My name is Eric. I am a scientist. I study the earth's capability to support human life. I chose to do this partly because I am a human - who is alive - and partly because this capability appears to be in decline. This choice seemed logical enough.

				<h2>Background</h2>
				<p>
					I have a B.S. in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_science">environmental science</a> from <a href="http://www.bucknell.edu">Bucknell</a>, an M.S. in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_science">environmental science</a> from <a href="http://environment.yale.edu">Yale</a>, an M.A. in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography">geography</a>, and a Ph.D. in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecoinformatics">ecoinformatics</a> from <a href="http://www.ucsb.edu">UCSB</a>. In general though, I am pretty knowledgable when it comes to the use of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system">geographic information software</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation">numerical modeling</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system">dynamical natural systems</a>, and big picture concepts related to <a href="http://www.uni-kiel.de/ecology/users/fmueller/salzau2006/studentpages/Human_Environmental_Interactions/index.html">human-environment interactions</a>. For those who are somewhat more visually inclined: this means that I spend most of my time working in the green and purple parts of this diagram. </p>

				<h2>Research</h2>
				<p>
					For the last few years I have done a considerable amount of work in the area of <a href="https://ideas.repec.org/a/pio/envirb/v35y2008i1p148-168.html">corridor location planning</a>. This basically just involves devising techniques to rapidly deduce the shortest path between two points positioned within a space characterized by multiple and continuously non-uniform costs. The specific approach that I am developing to solve this problem is pretty cool in that it harnesses the power of <a href="http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/id.3301,y.0,no.,content.true,page.3,css.print/issue.aspx">random walks</a>. These are interesting mathematical processes that show up in a surprisingly large number of contexts.

				<h2>Publications</h2>
				<p>
					When you're in the academic world, people put a lot of emphasis on the rate at which you can produce publications as well as the weight of the journals in which those publications appear. My attitude is somewhat different. I really am only interested in this type of scholarly writing in the extent to which it introduces creative new ideas that expand peoples' minds and potentially improve their lives. One must be both conscious of as well as cautious with the ways in which they allow this exercise to inform their definition of self worth. All that being said, here are some links to publications in which I have been involved. These are provided primarily to give those of you who are more technically inclined the opportunity to get a better understanding of the work which I do.

				<h2>Interests</h2>
				<p>
					I suppose like most people I do lots of different things. I really like to surf. So, if there are waves, I usually surf. I also really like to play soccer. So, if there are no waves, I usually play soccer. Probably also like most people, I really like to travel. But traveling tends to cost a lot of money. I don't really make much money. But most of the time that is ok. I've found that if you don't spend all your time making money then you have lots of time left over to do other things - at least things that don't cost too much money - like surfing or playing soccer. I've also never owned a car. So, if I need to get somewhere, I usually ride my bike. Below is a series of videos about a guy that cycled from Alaska to Argentina. I plan to do the same one day.

					I spend a lot of time listening to music. For the last couple of years I've been putting together a weekly playlist called the Friday Rare Grooves. Here's the entire collection in one place.
