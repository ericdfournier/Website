# Status

Completed

# Background

Our group at the California Center for Sutainable Communities was awarded a grant from the California Energy Commission to develop a comprehensive plan developing an "Advanced Energy Community" within a disadvantaged portion of Southern California. As part of this project we partnered with team members from The Energy Coalition, a not-for-profit implementer of energy efficiency upgrade programs, and Active San Gabriel Valley, a community based organization which conducts outreach events and engagement activities around the issues of energy, public health, and sustainable transportation solutions.

# Methods

This planning process used a combination of GIS based site suitability analysis techniques and building scale energy & economic modeling to assess the feasibility of different net-zero-electricty energy system transformations within the Bassett & Avocado Heights communities. 

# Results

All of the documentation, report deliverables, and other resources which were produced from the work conducted as part of the AEC-phase-I planning project are available at the following CCSC website: [Project Resources and Reporting Deliverables Website](https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/project/the-epic-challenge-accelerating-the-deployment-of-advanced-energy-communities/)

Lead by The Energy Coalition (TEC), our project team's proposal to the CEC for a second round of implementation funding (referred to as the AEC-phase-II) was successful. We have since begun work on this new stage of the project as a sub-contractor to TEC and are focusing on the project's various evaluation, measurement, and verification (EM&V) components.
