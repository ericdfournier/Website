# Background

CCSC is currently working as a sub-contractor to The Energy Coalition (TEC) to develop an "Advanced Energy Community" within the LA County unincorporated neighborhoods of Bassett and Avocado Heights. This project has a number of components including: the development of a local community solar generation facility whose output will support a Virtual Net Metering program, creation of a set of "Advanced Energy Homes" which will have a combination of distributed energy resources and electrified appliances, installation of publicly accessible EV charging infrastructure, air-quality monitoring, and more.
