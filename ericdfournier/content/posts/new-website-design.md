### An Explanation

Periodically I find occasion to revisit the design and hosting architecture of my personal website. 

The previous version was a slick as goose-shit, single page sort of deal. It was built off of a template that was probably designed for a startup's website or some creative person's photo portfolio. 

I got to thinking about how such a flashy design, while nice, doesn't really reflect the type of programming work that I do in my day to day life. 

Most of the programming that I do for work involves building machine learning models, writing numerical methods for spatial analysis and signal processing, etc. 

So I decided to switch to a format that better reflected the sober technical nature of my actual work.  

This newest version of the site, while much more utilitarian in its appearance, is far more extensible and performant in terms of the server architecture and content managament platform that it has been built with.

Anyways, its been a fun experience re-vamping everything and I look forward to being able to add more content, more frequently, content managament platform that it has been built with.
