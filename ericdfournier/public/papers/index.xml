Title Net GHG emissions and air quality outcomes from different residential building electrification pathways within a California disadvantaged community
Authors Eric Daniel Fournier, Felicia Federico, Robert Cudd, Stephanie Pincetl, Alex Ricklefs, Marc Costa, Michael Jerrett, Diane Garcia-Gonzales
Abstract Electrification of gas appliances in residential buildings will be necessary to rapidly decarbonize the energy system. In California however, recent rates of adoption of electric appliances, especially within disadvantaged and vulnerable communities (DVCs), have been insufficient to meet the state’s ambitious GHG emissions abatement targets.</description>

Title Implications of the timing of residential natural gas use for appliance electrification efforts
Authors Eric Daniel Fournier, Robert Cudd, Felicia Federico, Stephanie Pincetli
Abstract Current strategies for deep decarbonization of the residential building sector invoke the following three pillars of action: (1) radically improve the efficiency of end-use electricity consumption, (2) shift to 100% renewable generation of electrical grid power, and (3) move aggressively to electrify all remaining fossil fuel end-uses.</description>

Title Guidance on the usability-privacy tradeoff for utility customer data aggregation
Authors Benjamin L. Ruddell, Dan Cheng, Eric Daniel Fournier, Stephanie Pincetl, Caryn Potter, Richard Rushforth
Abstract Modern cities, along with their researchers and innovators can benefit from applying &amp;quot; big data&amp;quot; to their sus- tainability and infrastructure problems and policies, e.g., water and energy consumption. Unfortunately, current utility customer data (UCD) privacy rulemaking fails to ensure safe release of these data for the public benefit and does not currently strike a sound balance between the competing values of usability and privacy.</description>

Title Net Solar Potential from Urban Rooftops in Los Angeles
Authors Erik Porse, Eric Fournier, Dan Cheng, Claire Hirashiki, Hannah Gustafson, Felicia Federico, Stephanie Pincetl
Abstract Rooftops provide accessible locations for solar energy installations. While rooftop solar arrays can offset in- building electricity needs, they may also stress electric grid operations. Here we present an analysis of net electricity generation potential from distributed rooftop solar in Los Angeles.</description>

Authors Erik Porse, Kathryn B Mika, Alvar Escriva-Bou, Eric D Fournier, Kelly T Sanders, Edward Spang, Jennifer Stokes-Draut, Felicia Federico, Mark Gold, Stephanie Pincetl
Abstract Reducing energy consumption for urban water management may yield economic and environmental benefits. Few studies provide comprehensive assessments of energy needs for urban water sectors that include both utility operations and household use.</description>

Title Electricity infrastructure vulnerabilities due to long-term growth and extreme heat from climate change in Los Angeles County
Authors Daniel Burillo, Mikhail V Chester, Stephanie Pincetl, Eric Fournier
Abstract Many studies have estimated the effects of rising air temperatures due to climate change on electricity infrastructure systems, but none have quantified impacts in terms of potential outages down to the neighborhood scale. Using high-resolution climate projections, infrastructure maps, and forecasts of peak electricity demand for Los Angeles County (LAC), we estimated vulnerabilities in the electricity infrastructure to 2060.</description>

Title Effects of building size growth on residential energy efficiency and conservation in California
Authors Eric D Fournier, Felicia Federico, Erik Porse, Stephanie Pincetl
Abstract Many utility and government programs exist to promote energy efficiency (EE) in residential buildings. While programs have succeeded in reducing per square foot energy usage intensity (EUI), they do not necessarily promote conservation, in terms of reduced total energy consumption. Using statistical analysis and data mining techniques, we examined relationships between home size, electricity and natural gas EUIs, and neighborhood level socio-economic attributes among ∼1.</description>

Title Forecasting peak electricity demand for Los Angeles considering higher air temperatures due to climate change
Authors Daniel Burillo, Mikhail V Chester, Stephanie Pincetl, Eric D Fournier, Janet Reyna
Abstract Los Angeles County (LAC) is a large urbanized region with 9.7 million residents (as of 2010) and aging infrastructure. Population forecasts indicate that LAC will become home to an additional 1.2–3.1 million residents through 2060. Additionally, climate forecasts based upon representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios 4.</description>

Title MOGADOR revisited: Improving a genetic approach to multi-objective corridor search
Authors Eric D Fournier
Abstract The MOGADOR algorithm is a specialized heuristic approach to the shortest path problem, which employs genetic operators to the search for near optimal corridors within the context of multiple independent objectives. This article expands upon the work contained in the MOGADOR algorithm’s debut publication by introducing a set of refined techniques for initializing the algorithm, which are responsive to the characteristics of the problem specification, the desired runtime, and the global quality of the output solution set.</description>

Title Investigating the energy-water usage efficiency of the reuse of treated municipal wastewater for artificial groundwater recharge
Authors Eric D Fournier, Arturo A Keller, Roland Geyer, James Frew
Abstract This project investigates the energy-water usage efficiency of large scale civil infrastructure projects involving the artificial recharge of subsurface groundwater aquifers via the reuse of treated municipal wastewater. A modeling framework is introduced which explores the various ways in which spatially heterogeneous variables such as topography, landuse, and subsurface infiltration capacity combine to determine the physical layout of proposed reuse system components and their associated process energy-water demands.</description>

Title Minimizing impacts of land use change on ecosystem services using multi-criteria heuristic analysis
Authors Arturo A Keller, Eric Fournier, Jessica Fox
Abstract Development of natural landscapes to support human activities impacts the capacity of the landscape to provide ecosystem services. Typically, several ecosystem services are impacted at a single development site and various footprint scenarios are possible, thus a multi-criteria analysis is needed. Restoration potential should also be considered for the area surrounding the permanent impact site.</description>

Title Spectroscopic Investigations of Fe2+ Complexation on Nontronite Clay
Authors Rose B. Merola, Eric D. Fournier, Molly M. McGuire
Abstract Diffuse reflectance (visible) and attenuated total internal reflection Fourier-transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopies were used to examine a colloidal nontronite clay in the presence of Fe2+(aq). pH-dependent changes are observed in both types of spectra. In the visible region, a broad feature at ∼750 nm appears as the pH is raised to circumneutral values.</description>
